## Description:
Our website is meant to connect dog owners and their pets with others in their area who share common interests.

## Installation
Run 'npm i' to install all required dependencies for the application.  Using Sequel (MySQL) run 'source schema.sql' to create the database and then run 'npm run seed' (outside of sequel) to seed the database with hardcoded data.
## Usage
Once properly installed and seeded with data, you can run the application by running 'npm start' to fire up the server and view the website on localhost.
